# ðŸ“Œ Rules and Guidelines for Contributors

Welcome to the **NewtCode Chocolate Box** repository!
To keep this project organized, maintainable, and consistent, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## 1. General Conduct

* Be respectful and considerate when discussing issues or submitting feedback.
* Contributions should aim to improve the repository and follow best practices.
* Avoid posting sensitive or unrelated content.

## 2. Contribution Types

You can contribute in several ways:

* **Code improvements:** Fix bugs, refactor scripts, or add new features.
* **Documentation:** Update README, CHANGELOG, or add helpful notes.
* **Configuration files:** Add or improve settings.

## 3. Commits and Branches

* Use **feature branches** for new work:

```text
feature/<description>
fix/<description>
chore/<description>
```

* Commit messages should follow this style:

```text
feat(scope): Add a new feature
fix(scope): Fix a bug
chore(scope): Routine task, configuration update
docs(scope): Documentation change
style(scope): Formatting / styling only
```

* Keep commits **atomic**: one logical change per commit.

## 4. Pull Requests

* Before submitting a PR, ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
* Describe **what** changes were made and **why**.
* Reference any related issues or discussion.

## 5. Formatting and Standards

* Follow `.editorconfig` for consistent indentation, line endings, and encoding.
* Use `.gitattributes` rules to avoid unnecessary changes in line endings.
* For scripts, keep comments clear and meaningful.

## 6. Review Process

* All contributions are subject to review.
* Be open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
* Maintain a professional and cooperative attitude.
